abstract = {Sleep problems and disorders have a serious impact on human health and wellbeing. The rising costs for treating sleep-related chronic diseases in industrialized countries demands efficient prevention. Low-cost, wearable sleep / wake detection systems which give feedback on the wearer's "sleep performance" are a promising approach to reduce the risk of developing serious sleep disorders and fatigue. Not all bio-medical signals that are useful for sleep / wake discrimination can be easily recorded with wearable systems. Sensors often need to be placed in an obtrusive location on the body or cannot be efficiently embedded into a wearable frame. Furthermore, wearable systems have limited computational and energetic resources, which restrict the choice of sensors and algorithms for online processing and classification. Since wearable systems are used outside the laboratory, the recorded signals tend to be corrupted with additional noise that influences the precision of classification algorithms. In this thesis we present the research on a wearable sleep / wake classifier system that relies on cardiorespiratory (ECG and respiratory effort) and activity recordings and that works autonomously with minimal user interaction. This research included the selection of optimal signals and sensors, the development of a custom-tailored hardware demonstrator with embedded classification algorithms, and the realization of experiments in real-world environments for the customization and validation of the system. The processing and classification of the signals were based on Fourier transformations and artificial neural networks that are efficiently implementable into digital signal controllers. Literature analysis and empiric measurements revealed that cardiorespiratory signals are more promising for a wearable sleep / wake classification than clinically used signals such as brain potentials. The experiments conducted during this thesis showed that inter-subject differences within the recorded physiological signals make it difficult to design a sleep / wake classification model that can generalize to a group of subjects. This problem was addressed in two ways: First by adding features from another signal to the classifier, that is, measuring the behavioral quiescence during sleep using accelerometers. Conducted research on different feature extraction methods from accelerometer data showed that this data generalizes well for distinct subjects in the study group. In addition, research on user-adaptation methods was conducted. Behavioral sleep and wake measures, notably the measurement of reactivity and activity, were developed to build up a priori knowledge that was used to adapt the classification algorithm automatically to new situations. This thesis demonstrates the design and development of a low-cost, wearable hardware and embedded software for on-line sleep / wake discrimination. The proposed automatic user-adaptive classifier is advantageous compared to previously suggested classification methods that generalize over multiple subjects, because it can take changes in the wearer's physiology and sleep / wake behavior into account without adjustment from a human expert. The results of this thesis contribute to the development of smart, wearable, bio-physiological monitoring systems which require a high degree of autonomy and have only low computational resources available. We believe that the proposed sleep / wake classification system is a first promising step toward a context-aware system for sleep management, sleep disorder prevention, and reduction of fatigue.},

abstract = {Measuring peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) with pulse oximeters at the point of care is widely established. However, since [Formula: see text] is dependent on ambient atmospheric pressure, the distribution of SpO2 values in populations living above 2000 m a.s.l. is largely unknown. Here, we propose and evaluate a computer model to predict SpO2 values for pediatric permanent residents living between 0 and 4,000 m a.s.l. Based on a sensitivity analysis of oxygen transport parameters, we created an altitude-adaptive SpO2 model that takes physiological adaptation of permanent residents into account. From this model, we derived an altitude-adaptive abnormal SpO2 threshold using patient parameters from literature. We compared the obtained model and threshold against a previously proposed threshold derived statistically from data and two empirical data sets independently recorded from Peruvian children living at altitudes up to 4,100 m a.s.l. Our model followed the trends of empirical data, with the empirical data having a narrower healthy SpO2 range below 2,000 m a.s.l. but the medians never differed more than 2.3% across all altitudes. Our threshold estimated abnormal [Formula: see text] in only 17 out of 5,981 (0.3%) healthy recordings, whereas the statistical threshold returned 95 (1.6%) recordings outside the healthy range. The strength of our parametrized model is that it is rooted in physiology-derived equations and enables customization. Furthermore, as it provides a reference SpO2, it could assist practitioners in interpreting SpO2 values for diagnosis, prognosis, and oxygen administration at higher altitudes.},

abstract = {Knowledge of the importance of input features towards decisions made by machine-learning models is essential to increase our understanding of both the models and the underlying data. Here, we present a new approach to estimating feature importance with neural networks based on the idea of distributing the features of interest among experts in an attentive mixture of experts (AME). AMEs use attentive gating networks trained with a Granger-causal objective to learn to jointly produce accurate predictions as well as estimates of feature importance in a single model. Our experiments show (i) that the feature importance estimates provided by AMEs compare favourably to those provided by state-of-theart methods, (ii) that AMEs are significantly faster at estimating feature importance than existing methods, and (iii) that the associations discovered by AMEs are consistent with those reported by domain experts.},

The aim of the project is to bring medical devices to the attention of policy makers and to help guide both industry and government public health spending. The main objective of the Priority Medical Devices project is to identify gaps in the availability of preventive, diagnostic, therapeutic and assistive medical devices on the market. Mapping of gaps in the medical devices supply constitutes a priority for governments and key stakeholders because of the associated disease or disability. In addition, the project assessed potential barriers to innovation as well as generated a research agenda and action plan.},

abstract = {Copyright {\textcopyright} 2018, arXiv, All rights reserved. Learning representations for counterfactual inference from observational data is of high practical relevance for many domains, such as healthcare, public policy and economics. Counterfactual inference enables one to answer "What if...?" questions, such as "What would be the outcome if we gave this patient treatment t1?". However, current methods for training neural networks for counterfactual inference on observational data are either overly complex, limited to settings with only two available treatments, or both. Here, we present Perfect Match (PM), a method for training neural networks for counterfactual inference that is easy to implement, compatible with any architecture, does not add computational complexity or hyperparameters, and extends to any number of treatments. PM is based on the idea of augmenting samples within a minibatch with their propensity-matched nearest neighbours. Our experiments demonstrate that PM outperforms a number of more complex state-of-the-art methods in inferring counterfactual outcomes across several benchmarks, particularly in settings with many treatments.},

We explore a research methodology which emphasizes ongoing physical interaction with the environment as the primary source of constraint on the design of intelligent systems. We show how this methodology has recently had significant successes on a par with the most successful classical efforts.
